# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here, per
.cursorrules (each stage ends with a CHANGELOG update + commit on
branch cursor/stage-X-Y-description).

## Stage 0 — 2026-09-21
- Created `.cursorrules` at repo root (verbatim per docs/06_PRODUCTION.md §12).
- Copied the 7 spec files into `docs/`.
- Scaffolded monorepo skeleton: apps/mobile, apps/api, apps/admin,
  packages/api-contract, infra/, .github/workflows/.
- Initialized git repository.
- Not yet done: actual code scaffolding for Stage 1.1 (NestJS bootstrap,
  Flutter bootstrap) — blocked on network egress for the build sandbox
  (npm install / Flutter SDK install unavailable). Awaiting user
  confirmation on network access or on proceeding code-only.
